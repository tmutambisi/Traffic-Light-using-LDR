# Traffic-Light-using-LDR
This project implements a light-dependent resistor (LDR) control system using a microcontroller to manage LED indicators based on ambient light levels. The software uses a simple state machine to toggle between green, amber, and red LEDs depending on whether it's day or night, as determined by the LDR readings.
